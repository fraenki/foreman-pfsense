ABOUT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatically provision new pfSense firewalls with The Foreman.
Tested with pfSense 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, needs further testing on pfSense 2.2.

Should be used in conjunction with the pfSense puppet provider:
https://github.com/fraenki/puppet-pfsense


REQUIREMENTS / USAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- get The Foreman from http://theforeman.org/ :-)
- get the required FreeBSD provisioning files (customized mfsBSD):
  http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/FreeBSD
- add pfSense operatingsystem and desired version(s) to foreman 
  (use 2 as major and 1.4 as minor version number)
- recommended: create a local mirror for the pfSense memstick image(s)


DRAWBACKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- puppet is not yet available from the official pfSense repository:
  https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=79397.0
- pfSense 2.1 (FreeBSD 8.x) does not natively support VirtIO devices
- pfSense version numbers are not well supported in The Foreman
- pfSense is not yet recognized as a distribution, but instead listed as FreeBSD
- possible bug in KVM virtualization (coredump on first boot)
